## Read-And-Delete

My Final Coursera Project
Riley B
Date: 12.11.17

## Slide 2

My project uses the mtcars dataset, to predict horespower with miles per gallon and weight, with two different models.

---

My application takes two inputs: mpg and weight of the car.  

---

My application then produces two outputs: the output from the model with only mpg, and the output from the model with weight and mpg.

Thank you!
